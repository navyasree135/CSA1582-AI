Aim:
The aim of the code is to solve a cryptarithmetic puzzle, where letters in words represent unique digits. 
The goal is to assign digits (0–9) to the letters such that a given arithmetic equation (e.g., SEND + MORE = MONEY) is satisfied.
Steps in the Algorithm:
Input and Preprocessing:
Accept the list of words (words) and the result (result) as input.
Extract all unique letters from the words and the result.
If the number of unique letters exceeds 10 (more than available digits), declare the problem unsolvable.
Generate Permutations:
Generate all possible permutations of digits (0–9) for the unique letters using the itertools.permutations function.
Each permutation represents a possible mapping of letters to digits.
Mapping Letters to Digits:
For each permutation, create a dictionary (mapping) where:
The key is a unique letter.
The value is the corresponding digit from the permutation.
Output:
If a valid mapping is found, return the mapping as the solution.
If no valid mapping exists after exploring all permutations, return None.
Code:
print("cryptarthimetic")
def is_solution_valid(mapping, words, result):
    # Convert words and result to integers based on the mapping
    word_values = [int(''.join(str(mapping[c]) for c in word)) for word in words]
    result_value = int(''.join(str(mapping[c]) for c in result))
    return sum(word_values) == result_value
def solve_cryptarithmetic(words, result):
    all_letters = set(''.join(words + [result]))
    if len(all_letters) > 10:
        return None  # More than 10 unique letters; not solvable with single digits
    unique_letters = sorted(all_letters)
    permutations = range(10)  # All possible digit values
    from itertools import permutations as permute
    for perm in permute(permutations, len(unique_letters)):
        mapping = {letter: digit for letter, digit in zip(unique_letters, perm)}
        if mapping[result[0]] == 0:  # Leading zeros not allowed
            continue
        if is_solution_valid(mapping, words, result):
            return mapping
    return None  # No valid mapping found
# Example usage
print("SEND + MORE = MONEY")
words = ['send', 'more']
result = 'money'
solution = solve_cryptarithmetic(words, result)
if solution:
    print("Solution found:")
    for letter, digit in solution.items():
        print(f"{letter} = {digit}")
else:
    print("No solution found for the given cryptarithmetic problem.")
